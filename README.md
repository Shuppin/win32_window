**What is the project?** - This project is a UI library built from low level components to achieve easy creation of basic gui elements. It will use `skia` for (OpenGL Backend) to render basic shapes, curves and images onto a window, which will created  by the `windows` API.

**What is the MVP?** - Be able to write a program using this library to display text, buttons, images, icons, text fields and primitive shapes. The user will be able to layout these widgets using scrolling, rows, columns, grids and groups.

**What are nice to haves?**
- Retained mode rendering, only updating the areas of the screen which absolutely need updating.
- Some form of markup/scripting language to design UIs with.
- Widget customisation

**When will the project be complete?** - I aim to achieve an MVP within one month (End of october), from there I hope to complete new features as they come to mind.
